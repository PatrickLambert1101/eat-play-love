    My weekend at the farm was nothing short of amazing. It came at the perfect time in my life when I was feeling rather depleted. Carly’s hospitality was incredible, she whips up the most amazing vegan meals that keep you on top of the world. The retreat is beautiful and the time spent with wonderful women allowed me to step into my power and break down trust barriers. Highly recommend for anyone needing relaxation and a bit of a reset. PS: the yoga and massages were also incredible! There’s too much to mention...... Just Go! It’ll be good for you
