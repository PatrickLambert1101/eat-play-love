We created Eat Play Love with exactly those ingredients in mind.
We run retreats and workshops in beautiful spaces as an opportunity to bring women together and share in a safe and supported environment where connection is honoured above status, where creativity is honoured above outcome and being is honoured above doing.

Weâ€™re two besties who have a passion and LOVE for:

Delicious nutritious Plant-Based foods // Mind Body Spirit Alignment // Creative Expression // CONNECTION // Heart space // Empowered Authentic WOMEN // Soul stirring & Heart opening // Conscious Expansion // Sharing tools // FUN // Healing // Being REAL // MAGIC // Nature // PLAY // Support // Self - Love

Becca has experience in teaching art & cooking up a storm in any kitchen, and she can turn a carnivore into a Vegan with just one meal! Seriously!
Liz has studied psychology, NLP, Life Coaching & loves a deep and meaningful convo any time of the day. She has experience in and a real love for facilitating change, transformation & anything that evokes true connection.
We strongly support and foster emotional intelligence and hope to bring each member of our retreats closer to who they really are. We believe that each and every one of us is more than ENOUGH just as we are, and we hope to remind you of that.
