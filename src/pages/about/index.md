We are Event planners, stylists, problem solvers, hosts, creative thinkers, and we love to make things beautiful and extra special.

We are very client focused and love to get to know the people we work with.  We like to push ideas and do things that might be a little bit alternative and lots of fun! We bring loads of creativity, love and energy to each event we plan, style and create.

We love Events & weddings and we love what we do!!

Hi Im Becca, Stylist and co-founder of Eat Play Love events & Experiences. I am a mom to little Max and soon to be wife to Pat ( we are also planning a festival wedding). I would describe myself as a creative, coffee addict, idea maker and a people person & host.
I really love what I do at Eat Play Love Events & Experiences. Every day is different with a lot of fun, laughs, chats and coffee. Iâ€™ve always loved to host events and grew up on a farm where we have a Venue so weddings & event planning is something I know inside out.
