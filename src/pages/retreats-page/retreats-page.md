As a passion project, we also coordinate and host women’s wellness retreats for the love of connection and coming together to share in beautiful spaces.

We run retreats and workshops in beautiful spaces as an opportunity to bring women together and share in a safe and supported environment where connection is honoured above status, where creativity is honoured above outcome and being is honoured above doing.

We’re two besties who have a passion and LOVE for:

Delicious nutritious Plant-Based foods // Mind Body Spirit Alignment // Creative Expression // CONNECTION // Heart space // Empowered Authentic WOMEN // Soul stirring & Heart opening // Conscious Expansion // Sharing tools // FUN // Healing // Being REAL // MAGIC // Nature // PLAY // Support // Self - Love

We strongly support and foster emotional intelligence and hope to bring each member of our retreats closer to who they really are. We believe that each and every one of us is more than ENOUGH just as we are, and we hope to remind you of that.

We run these retreats in the quieter winter months, so please keep an eye on our website to see when our next retreat is happening.
