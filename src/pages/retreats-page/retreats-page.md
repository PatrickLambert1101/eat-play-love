    I recently moved back to Haenertsburg which is a little farming community in the Wolkberg mountains of Limpopo. Its where I grew up and spent most of my teenage years pining for a bigger more adventurous world. I left as soon as I could and embraced the big cities and foreign countriesâ€¦little did I know how much my heart would pine for the open spaces, the shining stars and the local pub.
